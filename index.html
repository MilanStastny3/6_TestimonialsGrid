          for the free intro course and found it incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly thereafter. 
          The next 12 weeks was the best - and most grueling - time of my life. Since completing
          the course, I've successfully switched careers, working as a Software Engineer at a VR "

          "Before joining the bootcamp, I've never written a line of code. I needed some structure from
          professionals who can help me learn programming steb by step. I was encouraged to enroll by
          a former student of theirs who can only say wonderful things about the program. The entire
          curriculum and staff did not disappoint. They were very hands-on and I never had to wait 
          long for assistance. The agile team project, in particular, was outstanding. It took my
          learning to the next level in a way that no tutorial could ever have. In fact, I've often
          reffered to it during interviews as an example of my development experience. It certainly
          helped me land a job as a full-stack developer after receiving multiple offers. 100%
          recommend!"
